# film-robot

Contacted by film group of the American Film Institute and asked for services in building a robotic “actor” similar to Wall-E with programmable eyes, pan-tilt head, and joystick control.

Robot uses Raspberry Pi for high level control, display interfacing, and media storage. It communicates with an Arduino through serial. Arduino performs low level control.![IMG_0149]
